# Account linking with Alexa to Facebook

This is a basic tutorial on how to link a Facebook account to an Alexa skill using Amazon Account linking.

## Install
Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed

git clone https://github.com/matchboxmobile/AlexaFacebook.git 

cd AlexaFacebook

npm install alexa-sdk

npm install facebook-node

## How to run it?
You now need to zip the index.js and the node_modules file. This is what is needed to upload to Amazon when asked to upload code when setting up a Lamba function.
